In her talk, Laila Bougria explores the trade-offs between Orchestration and Choreography in distributed architecture.
She emphasizes the importance of identifying coupling within system components, focusing not only on runtime coupling but also on semantic coupling through shared contracts.

Laila highlights that orchestration is advantageous for managing complex workflows, accommodating frequent changes, or when maintaining order is crucial.
A centralized workflow modification point significantly aids in these scenarios. The talk also covers the concept of passive-aggressive events and the reasons to avoid them.
