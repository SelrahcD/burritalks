Justin Searls remarks that a lot of test harnesses are hard to understand because there is no clear definition of the type of tests we're expected to use. Tests of different types, verifying multiple things at once, without clear goals are mixed. Facing this kind of test, we're lost. We don't know what test we're supposed to write, where it should go, we lose time, argue, get frustrated...

To remediate this situation, Justin describes different types of tests and guidelines to write them.
