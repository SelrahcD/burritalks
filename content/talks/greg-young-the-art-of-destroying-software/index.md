Greg Young explains that one of the more essential characteristics of systems is their ability to be deleted and rewrote from scratch in a small amount of time.
He argues that it's often time simpler to rewrite a piece of code instead of moving it in a direction that wasn't the one considered up until now.

He then shares his rule of no service should be complex enough to need more than a one-week rewrite and points out that objects, micro-services, actor, processes are conceptually the same thing.
