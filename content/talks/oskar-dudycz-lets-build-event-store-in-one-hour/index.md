Event sourcing can be scary. Building an Event Store even more.

In less than an hour, Oskar Dudycz shows how you can implement an event store with everything you need to get started. Of course, that event store offers fewer features than other solutions already available - and you should use them instead - but building one yourself, or seeing Oskar creating one, give you a good overview of all the building blocks.
