Daniel Vacanti uses the story of the Titanic to teach the impact of pull policies,  the decisions we make around which item to work on. Along the journey, he talks about the relationship between Work In Progress and Cycle Time and how we can use Aging Chart to prioritize which work to do.
Using a different pull policy, the Titanic might have arrived in New-York.
