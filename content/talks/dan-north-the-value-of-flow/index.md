Dan North shares his recipe for improving flow in an organisation: visualise, measure current efficiency, curate what goes into the system to stabilise the system, and then gradually optimise. He contrasts resource efficiency vs. system efficiency: measuring how busy people are doesn't improve the system's efficiency; it actually reduces it until the system halts.
He also notes that in most systems percentage of waiting time, the time spent by an item not being worked on is greater than 90%.
