Gojko Adzic starts by setting-up the stage by sharing some terminology. He presents all the advantages of going serverless, from letting the provider dealing with running the code, improving scalability and availability, cost reduction, to using off the shelf services for generic needs. He then shares his observations on the implications of going serverless on the way we design our systems, towards a more event driven architecture and smaller moving parts.
