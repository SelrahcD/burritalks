Kevlin Henney discusses what is essential about test cases. He gives a perfect explanation of the way test names should be written and what information they should convey using the leap year problem. Using FizzBuzz, he shows that the form of the code has a huge influence on code coverage and that only being interested in line coverage is really misleading. Toward the end, he briefly talks about property-based testing.
