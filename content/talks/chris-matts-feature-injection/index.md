In this video, Chris Matts describes how we can slice a big chunk of work into deliverable slices by focusing on User Needs, User Segments and Business Value.

He shows how a seemingly simple request as making a cup of tea can ballon into a gigantic task if we don't know what we're after.

He then explains how using Gherkin, in reverse order, helps identify the shortest path for value delivery and what could go wrong.
