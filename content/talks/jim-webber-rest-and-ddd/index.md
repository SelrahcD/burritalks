Jim Webber shows how Rest APIs communicates application states and supported actions through hypermedia. He takes the example of a fake coffehouse to show how applying these ideas help translating buying a coffee to an API. 

In the second part he discusses what's needed to translate a domain model to the web's document model and describes some useful patterns for communication.
