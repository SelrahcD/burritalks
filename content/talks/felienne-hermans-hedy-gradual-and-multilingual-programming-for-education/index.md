In this fun talk, Felienne Hermans shares all the fun and difficulties of building a programming language to teach kids to code. The language is both gradual - it has different levels with different functionalities - and is multilingual - you can program in many human languages.
Felienne discusses some of her discoveries about improving error messages, dealing with right-to-left and left-to-right languages, and representing numbers in Arabic.
