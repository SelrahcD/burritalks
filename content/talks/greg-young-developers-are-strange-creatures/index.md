Greg Young describes some developers' stereotypical behaviors, explains where they came from, and proposes some discussions to help change the situation.

According to him, developers are:

* Looking for maximum reuse
* Aiming to solve nonexistent problems
* Being more interested in tools than in solving business problems
* Creating unnecessary abstraction in the name of simplification and reuse
* Trying to build unbreakable systems at all costs
