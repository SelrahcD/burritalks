Gary Bernhardt proposes a solution to the main problem related to test stubs usage: not execising the real code.

He introduces the concept of value, simple value or objects with only pure functions, and shows how to use them in the 3 main programming paradigms.

He then describes how separating code bases in two, core and shell, - or functional core / imperative shell - allows for fast and simple testing strategies.
