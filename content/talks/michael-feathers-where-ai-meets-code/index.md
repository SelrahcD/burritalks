In this talk, Michael Feathers shows how he uses AI in his work with code. He highlights some of the patterns he finds interesting, such as asking for multiple draft solutions to get more ideas, asking the AI to generate a mathematical representation of the code, creating throw away characterization tests, inventing words to describe what he has just done and reuse it elsewhere, and many more.
