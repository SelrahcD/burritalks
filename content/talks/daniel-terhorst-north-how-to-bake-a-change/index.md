Daniel Terhorst-North explains how he approaches helping organizations improve. First, you must understand their goal and current situation via interviews and measurement and facilitate alignment. Then, you must decide where to act, collaboratively with people in the organization, using experiments. He coined the VESSA acronym for Visualise, Eliminate, Simplify, Standardise, and Automate. Always start with Visualizing to understand the situation and align people.
